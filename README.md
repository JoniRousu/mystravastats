# My Strava Stats

A tool to calculates and displays many statistics about Strava activities.

This tool scans through activities and looks for the best effort for distance or time span during the examined year. For
example, it finds for the fastest consecutive 1 km, 5 km, 10 km you've run, or the fastest 2 hours, 3 hours in ride
activities.

Eddington number is the largest number, E, such that you have ridden at least E km on at least E days. MyStravaStats
calculate Eddington number for rides, runs and hikes.

Best Cooper (12 min) : In the original form, the point of the test is to run as far as possible within 12 minutes. MyStravaStats look for with a 'sliding window' the best effort for the given time (12 minutes) on running activities.

Best vVO2max (6 min) : This is the smallest speed that requires VO2 max in an accelerated speed test. MyStravaStats look for with a 'sliding window' the best effort for the given time (6 minutes) on running activities.

## Build mystravastats

Build mystravastats :
```
./gradlew jar
```

## Launch mystravastats

My Strava Stats needs several parameters :

*Mandatory parameters*

* -clientId: your applicationâ€™s ID. You can your find your client id on this page : https://www.strava.com/settings/api
* -clientSecret: your client secret. You can your find client secret on this page : https://www.strava.com/settings/api

*Optional parameters*

* -year: the year you request (default value is the current year).
* -csv : to export all activities in a CSV file.
* -filter: to filter exported activities on a specific distance in meters. For example : -csv -filter 10000 will display
  all the activities around 10000 m (+/- 5 %)
  
### launch mystravastats 

Download activities from 2011 to now then display statistics.

Activities are download in a local directory, in that way only new and missing ones are downloaded from Strava. For
people with a huge amount of long activities, I recommend to increase memory for example : -Xmx2048m (Set the maximum
memory size to 2048 megabytes).
```
java -Xmx2048m -jar ./build/libs/mystravastats.jar -clientId [clientId] -clientSecret [clientSecret]
```

Display statistics for current year using locally download activities.
```
java -Xmx2048m -jar ./build/libs/mystravastats.jar -clientId [clientId] 
```

Display statistics for specified year using locally download activities.
```
java -Xmx2048m -jar ./build/libs/mystravastats.jar -clientId [clientId] -year 2019
```

Export activities in a CSV file using locally download activities (current year) :
```
java -Xmx2048m -jar ./build/libs/mystravastats.jar -clientId [clientId] -csv 
```

Display export activities in a CSV file with a filter using locally download activities (current year) :
```
java -Xmx2048m -jar ./build/libs/mystravastats.jar -clientId [clientId] -csv -filter 10000
```

A URL will be displayed copy/past it in a browser to get allow mystravastats to access your Strava data. 
This URL will look like :
```
http://www.strava.com/api/v3/oauth/authorize?client_id=[YOUR_CLIENT_ID]&response_type=code&redirect_uri=http://localhost/exchange_token&approval_prompt=force&scope=read_all,profile:read_all,activity:read_all
```
Login to Strava then click 'Authorize' and tick the required permissions if needed.
